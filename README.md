## Setting Up Development Environment

 Setting up development Environment requires :
* [Github](https://www.github.com "Github Homepage")
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js Homepage")
* [Grunt: The JavaScript Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/ "Grunt.js Homepage")
        
**Github** - Github is used for collaborating codes and Version Controlling.

**Node.js** - Node.js is used as base dependency for preprocessing source code and building Build

**Grunt** - Grunt is JavaScript Task Runner which run over Node.js platform and preprocess, link, assemble sources. It builds Project Build

### Installing Github

There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub for Windows. The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI. It also works well with Powershell, and sets up solid credential caching and sane CRLF settings. You can download this from the GitHub for Windows website, at [Github Windows](http://windows.github.com)
